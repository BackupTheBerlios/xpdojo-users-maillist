Subject: [Xpdojo-users] The no file incident
Message-ID: <42A166EE.4060806@club-internet.fr>

Hi xpdojo developers,

I report here the "no file" incident (I'd like to stop terming things 
"bugs". One gets addicted to misrepresentations contained in the word).

Short description :
When a module source name and the module name don't match by Erlang 
syntax rules, testing_server halts instead of reporting the error. 
(xpdojo revision used : 56)

Symptom:
launch erl and start a testing_server loop :

 > testing_server:start(".", fun(M)->io:format("~w\n",[M]) end, 
xpdojo:default_options()).

edit a new file : foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([bar/0]).

bar() ->
    ok.

and save it. (testing_server compiles it in the background). Then edit 
the file again and change the module name (not a good thing to do) :
-module(bar).

and save again.

Expected result :
testing_server should signal an error akin to the message we get with 
the command c(foo) :
 > c(foo).
** Module name 'bar' does not match file name 'foo' **
{error,badfile}

Obtained result :
testing_server stops with an error in process :

Error in process <0.90.0> with exit value: 
{{badmatch,{error,nofile}},[{xpdojo,'-post_compile/2-fun-0-',1},{lists,foreach,2},{xpdojo,post_compile,2},{xpdojo,with,3},{testing_server,loop,3}]}

and have to be started again.


Supposed origin :
xpdojo found a source file defining a module "bar", but the 
corresponding code file "bar.beam" cannot be found, because it hasn't 
been compiled.


Significance :
In almost any Erlang project, a source file named "foo.erl" should begin 
with the line "-module(foo)." Yet, many Erlang beginners will mistakenly 
infringe this rule, if only on account of mis-typing . Emacs erlang mode 
gently warns the user "Module does not match file name. Modify source (y 
or n) ?" and get him/her back on track, but not every source editor 
will. (As a matter of fact I bumped into this one by typing 
"-module(foo.erl).", a declaration upon which Emacs found nothing to 
complain about).

Once you are used to Erlang syntax, halting the testing server with such 
an error is rather unlikely, but it can have a negative impact on 
newcomers both to Erlang and xpdojo. The way I see it, testing_server is 
part of my Erlang IDE, and I'm less productive if my IDE stops on such 
an error instead of warning me. Agreed, is not as if the whole system 
crashed (which happens in very popular commercial IDEs) but still it can 
be an annoyance.

Thank you for listening,
Regards to all.
Christophe.

The other day, when the lists server was down, Christophe 
sent me privately:

 >> Here the results of test_files(".") on revision 56 on my
 >> win98 and linux platforms.

Thanks! Those results show that Nico and I worked too late
last tuesday:

- we forgot to make the new acceptance test portable on
platforms that don't support symlinks.
- we forgot to use the brand new "fuzzy list comparison"
function for unit tests that list directory contents...

I believe I fixed those things tonight (revision 57), but I 
can't be sure as the symptoms only appear on other platforms.

Cheers,

Dominic.

I attached the results on my win98 and my linux platforms.
Maybe I should investigate further on these platforms rather than just 
sending the results :-). Please tell me if there's anything more I can 
check or look at.

Regards.
Christophe
