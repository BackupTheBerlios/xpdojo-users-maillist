 &gt;&gt; It works ! Only I should give it a notification function

 &gt;&gt; because with this I have my erl shell continuously
 &gt;&gt; displaying the same errors. A smarter function would not
 &gt;&gt; print Msg again if the tests results are unchanged. I'll
 &gt;&gt; try to do that.
 &gt;
 &gt; In fact only compile errors are displayed again and again,
 &gt; while reporting the same broken tests doesn't trigger the
 &gt; notification function again. Is it deliberately wanted
 &gt; behaviour ?

Ah, OK, I understand now. I was wondering why you first said
the same errors are continuously displayed, because that is
not supposed to happen. However, if you have compile errors,
I understand. It's not actually deliberate, but at least I
know why!

It all boils down to how xpdojo:test_files/2 computes the
'unchanged' state: by comparing the list and age of loaded
modules with the list and age of source code. It also so
happens that a module is purged from the code loader just
/before/ compilation, so when a compilation fails, the new
version can't be loaded, but the old one is lost! So xpdojo
thinks that the source tree has a new module, and doesn't
consider the tree 'unchanged'.

I'd say that's a bug, because test_files/2 should really
return unchanged. I'll add it to the TODO.

 &gt; BTW, I did run the whole thing under emacs, splitting
 &gt; windows between code, tests and the Erlang shell, and
 &gt; there it was : my first experiment with an IDE offering
 &gt; parallel background validation ! Now you can twidle with a
 &gt; small piece of code, and somewhere on the same screen, a
 &gt; status line change from {unit,11,10} to {unit,11,11} just
 &gt; as if it was syntax highlighting. Isn't it a Great Day or
 &gt; what? Well maybe I'm just too solemn about it. ( I work in
 &gt; a place where the delay between editing and testing code
 &gt; is generally stated in months :-)

That's cool. You know, you're the first one to benefit from
it, because at the moment, although the continuous server
works for other projects, we can't use it on XP Dojo itself

Dominic.
