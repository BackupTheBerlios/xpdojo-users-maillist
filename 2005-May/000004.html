<PRE>Ok, now the list seems to work (or I seem to be able using it)..

Hello XpDojo Developers,

I've been using xpdojo for more than 3 weeks now. It's a very 
interesting experience. My programming activities in Erlang were already 
following a relatively easy process :
- editing then saving code with emacs
- launching compilation with make:all() (or hitting twice the up arrow 
key within command history) on erl
- executing tests on erl (idem)

and now it's simpler :
- editing then saving code with emacs
- launch xpdojo:test_fuiles(&quot;.&quot;) (or one up arrow key)

and I think it will be even simpler when I can merely save my files in 
the editor and just have a look at the tests results in erl, having the 
tests automatically executed when I save the source code.

As an Erlang beginner, and writing code for TDD/Erlang beginners, I find 
it particulary interesting that the process of compiling, finding and 
executing the test functions need not to be known and seen, making work 
faster, in a more flexible way, and setting up the developer early in a 
minimal methodologic frame (code, unit tests, acceptance tests). What I 
mean is this : when I learned how to program in C, all I needed was an 
editor, a compiler and a linker. I could just start, printf(&quot;hello 
world&quot;) and that was that. Regarding the methodology howtos, there was 
absolutely nothing in these tools that could guide me through an even 
minimal validation process (how will I state my intentions, how will I 
know the program is valid, etc.) With xpdojo, right from the start, when 
typing my first program in Erlang, I'm invited to write an acceptance 
test, then write an unit test and then start the coding cycle. It like 
it because while it's a real &quot;anti-hacking&quot; (or fiddling) strategy wired 
in the tool, it doesn't impose a great burden on the apprentice. 
Remember the introductory sermon about software quality you have to bear 
in *any* text about Ada language ? It's like they'd say : you can learn 
how to create correct sentences in Ada, but there's much more to it. 
Here, there's nothing to it : you can learn some Erlang, and at the same 
time you can write your first tests.

In answer, Dominic, to your invitation to participate in xpdojo as an XP 
customer (sort of, since I certainly won't pretend to set up &quot;business 
priorities&quot; of course), I submit the following two users stories. The 
first one describes the supplementary level of confort I'd like to have 
as an xpdojo user. I tried to hack an auto report process with 
testing_server, but I'll leave it to you, finally, I think I'm not yet 
that good ;-). I might be wrong, but I think a lot of the code written 
in xpdojo as of today just answers to this user story.

The 2d story allows one to choose other name conventions for test 
modules and test functions, different from the default set up in 
xpdojo.erl, and allows doing this from the outset of the project, i.e. 
without having to explicitely provide theses options in Erlang code :
   [{unit_modules_filter, adlib:ends_with(&quot;ut&quot;)},
     {unit_functions_filter, adlib:ends_with(&quot;test&quot;)} ...]

My intention is to create soon some acceptance tests for these two 
stories; of course before that I'm willing to revise them according to 
our discussions. Feedback welcome !

Regards
Christophe Thibaut.
