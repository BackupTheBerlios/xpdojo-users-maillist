<PRE>Hi Christophe,

&gt;<i> I made some investigation about the enoent error 
</I>&gt;<i> occurring with emacs on linux and I wrote a manual test,
</I>&gt;<i>  and a unit test (sort of). I even tried a fix that
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to work for me, but which couldn't by all means
</I>&gt;<i> qualify as a definitive solution.
</I>
Thanks very much for all the groundwork. You saved us a lot
of time investigating, and I didn't even know about
read_link_info. Your suggested fix does have a side-effect,
unfortunately, which is that people can't use a (correct)
symlink to refer to a real erlang source file any more...
I've seen this done to handle things like cross-platform
development.

Right now I can' think of any other situation (than the
emacs thing) in which this enoent error would occur, so I'm
thinking we might just catch the runtime error, report a
warning, and continue.

&gt;<i> I'm still quite annoyed by the fact that I didn't have 
</I>&gt;<i> all unit tests passing for xpdojo. I didn't try to 
</I>&gt;<i> understand why (and I didn't remember Dominic's 
</I>&gt;<i> explanations about xpdojo ability to test itself, and the
</I>&gt;<i>  way it should do this),
</I>
Yeah, that is really strange. Could you just run
xpdojo:test_files() on xpdojo (that works fine, what doesn't
work is the continuous test server), and send us the output? 
Also give us the Erlang version you are using.

&gt;<i> and I tried this without really understanding what would
</I>&gt;<i> happened if xray collected symlinks info just as it
</I>&gt;<i> collect file info. What is to be done with a symlink ?
</I>
As I mentioned above, people sometimes use symlink for
source files, so they should be /followed through/ to the
pointed file (which is what read_file_info does), not
treated specially (which is what read_link_info does).

The problem here is that we have an /invalid/ symlink.

&gt;<i> Anyway I just send these informations, as a track for you
</I>&gt;<i>  to explore the problem further, and of course I leave it
</I>&gt;<i>  to you developers to design a complete fix to this 
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>
Hey, don't worry, if we didn't want people nosing around and
being helpful, we wouldn't have open-sourced ;-)

Thanks again,

Dominic.
