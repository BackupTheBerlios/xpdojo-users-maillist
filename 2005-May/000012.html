<PRE>Hi xpdojo developers,

I made some investigation about the enoent error occurring with emacs on 
linux and I wrote a manual test, and a unit test (sort of). I even tried 
a fix that seemed to work for me, but which couldn't by all means 
qualify as a definitive solution.

* Symptom :
With emacs on linux, in a given directory, edit a new file :
-module(bug_enoent).
-export([foo/0]).

foo() -&gt;
      ok.
then save it, then edit it again and don't save it.
In the same directory, launch an erl session
type xpdojo:test_files(&quot;.&quot;).
expected : [{acceptance,0,0},{unit,0,0},{modules,1,1}]
obtained : ** exited: {{badmatch,{error,enoent}}, [{adlib,xray,4}, etc..

* Significance :
The enoent exception abruptly stops the xpdojo compile &amp; test process, 
so xpdojo is much less useful when using emacs as an editor on Linux 
platform, and especially the testing_server feature.

* Origin :
Whenever emacs enters in a mode in wich a file is currently edited but 
not saved yet, emacs creates a special symbolic link corresponding to 
the file. (why emacs behaves like that could be an interesting subject, 
but I didn't want to dive into it immediately).

xpdojo, when triggered, scans the given directory for modified source 
files to compile and tests to execute. Troubles come when the special 
link is encountered : the xray/4 function, in an attempt to collect file 
information about the files in the directory, stops with an enoent 
exception on evaluation of file:read_file_info(filename:join(Root,Item), 
just when the given Item refers to the emacs special symbolic link.

* Evidence :
Suppose we have edited but not saved bug_enoent.erl. We are under erl :
 &gt; ls().
#bug_enoent.erl#     .#bug_enoent.erl     bug_enoent.beam
bug_enoent.erl       bug_enoent.erl~

The 2nd file is the special link. Although we have no problem reading
the currently edited file :

 &gt; file:read_file_info(&quot;bug_enoent.erl&quot;).
{ok,{file_info,59, regular,  read_write,  {{2005,5,23},{23,14,40}}, 
{{2005,5,23},{23,15,33}}, {{2005,5,23},{23,15,33}}, 33188, 1, 774, 0, 
1305052, 501, 501}}

We have a problem reading file info on the link :
 &gt; file:read_file_info(&quot;.#bug_enoent.erl&quot;).
{error,enoent}

If we read /link/ info instead, we don't have get an error :
 &gt; file:read_link_info(&quot;.#bug_enoent.erl&quot;).
{ok,{file_info,31, symlink, none, {{2005,5,23},{23,18,52}}, 
{{2005,5,23},{23,18,52}}, {{2005,5,23},{23,18,52}}, 41471, 1, 774, 
0,1305051, 501, 501}}

* Automated test :
In the attached file bug_enoent_ut.erl is a test related to the problem. 
This test creates a directory from the parent directory, not a subdir, 
in order to have test_files() working properly. Not to try this directly 
from your home directory !
 
* Solution ?
file:read_link_info/2 reads information about any link, including 
symbolic links, while read_file_info reads only about files. Maybe if 
xray could use read_link_info instead of read_file_info, the pattern 
{_,_,symlink} could be used to filter out symlinks from the list xray is 
collecting info about, so that it would work no further with the symlink 
and would skip to the next file in the list ?

* Shameless Hack

First, I runned xpdojo:test_files(&quot;.&quot;) on my xpdojo/src original dir and 
got {unit, 88, 84}. There's something wrong with my platform, or with my 
testing. Anyway, I was too curious to give up so I tried this :

in adlib.erl, line # 200 replace
{ok,File_info} = file:read_file_info(filename:join(Root,Item)),
with
{ok,File_info} = file:read_link_info(filename:join(Root,Item)),

runned the tests again, and still got {unit,88,84}, but bug_enoent_ut 
now pass. I tried an xpdojo session emacs and the testing_server, and as 
far as I can tell, xpdojo and emacs now agree on what to compile and 
what to test.

* Conclusion :
It seems on the surface that we may work around emacs special habits of 
creating symlinks for currently edited files. On my linux station these 
symlinks are no longer stopping me from using xpdojo as far as I can 
tell. I'm quite content with this partial result, as I worried having to 
abandon emacs for my coding in Erlang.

I'm still quite annoyed by the fact that I didn't have all unit tests 
passing for xpdojo. I didn't try to understand why (and I didn't 
remember Dominic's explanations about xpdojo ability to test itself, and 
the way it should do this), and I tried this without really 
understanding what would happened if xray collected symlinks info just 
as it collect file info. What is to be done with a symlink ?

Anyway I just send these informations, as a track for you to explore the 
problem further, and of course I leave it to you developers to design a 
complete fix to this problem.

Thanks for your attention.
Regards --ct
